        <h3>NORA.</h3>
            <p>Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
            see it until this evening, when it is dressed. <span id="red_para">_[To the PORTER, taking
            out her purse.]_</span> How much?</p>

        <h3>PORTER.</h3>
        <p>Sixpence.</p>

        <h3>NORA.</h3>
            <p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change. <span id="red_para">_[The PORTER thanks her, and
            goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
            off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
            and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
            listens.]_</span> Yes, he is in.<span id="red_para"> _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the
            right.]_</span></p>

        <h3>HELMER.</h3>
            <p><span id="red_para">_[calls out from his room]_</span>. Is that my little lark twittering out
            there?</p>

        <h3>NORA.</h3>
            <p><span id="red_para">_[busy opening some of the parcels]_</span>. Yes, it is!</p>

        <h3>HELMER.</h3>
            <p>Is it my little squirrel bustling about?</p>

        <h3>NORA.</h3>
            <p>Yes!</p>
