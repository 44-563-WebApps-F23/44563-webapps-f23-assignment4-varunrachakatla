            <p>Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not
            see it until this evening, when it is dressed.</p> <p id="red_para">_[To the PORTER, taking
            out her purse.]_</p> <p>How much?</p>

        <h4>PORTER.</h4>
        <p>Sixpence.</p>

        <h4>NORA.</h4>
            <p>There is a shilling. No, keep the change. </p><p id="red_para">_[The PORTER thanks her, and
            goes out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes
            off her hat and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket
            and eats one or two; then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and
            listens.]_</p> <p>Yes, he is in.</p><p id="red_para"> _[Still humming, she goes to the table on the

            there?</p>

        <h4>NORA.</h4>

        <h4>HELMER.</h4>

        <h4>NORA.</h4>
            <p>Yes!</p>
